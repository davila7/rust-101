## Features of Rust

Rust is a modern programming language that offers several key features:

- **Speed**: Rust is designed for performance, enabling developers to write fast and efficient code. Its zero-cost abstractions ensure that high-level features do not come at the expense of performance.

- **Safety**: Rust's ownership model guarantees memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This prevents common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.

- **Concurrency**: Rust makes concurrent programming easier and safer. Its ownership and type system help prevent data races at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code with confidence.

- **Portability**: Rust is designed to be portable across various platforms. It compiles to native code and can run on different operating systems, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Happy coding!
